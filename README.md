Observations: 

All three functions are doing the same thing, but 
each with different and more complex structures resulting in entirely 
different assembly code. addmatsSimple is written in C and 
has all functionality written in main, resulting in simple 
assembly code. addmatsSubr is also written in C but uses 
functions to add the matrices. addmats is the most complex written 
in C++ incorporating functions and classes.
